Customer Churn Prediction using ML:  Effective solution to anticipate customer churn, improve retention, and drive business growth

## Introduction
Customer churn is a major issue for every firm, especially those in the telecommunications industry. Churn is the occurrence in which clients cancel their services or memberships with a company. Identifying consumers who are likely to churn ahead of time can greatly benefit the organization by allowing it to take proactive actions to keep these customers.
The goal of this study is to apply Machine Learning (ML) techniques to anticipate customer turnover in a telecommunications company. We can uncover patterns and factors that contribute to churn by studying past customer data and developing a predictive model. This will allow the telecommunications company to develop targeted retention measures and improve customer satisfaction, reducing churn and enhancing long-term business performance.

## Problem Statement:
The problem that we want to address is predicting customer attrition in a telecommunications company using historical customer data. We will create a predictive model that can categorize clients as churned or non-churned by applying machine learning methods on the given dataset. The goal is to develop an accurate and dependable model to assist the Telco company in reducing customer turnover.

## Objectives:
Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset, handle missing values (if any), and encode categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform a comprehensive analysis of the dataset to identify patterns, correlations, and insights that may influence churn.

Feature Selection: Select the most relevant features that have a significant impact on churn prediction.

Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for classification and compare their performance.

Model Training: Train the selected models on the preprocessed data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using appropriate evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the chosen models by tuning hyperparameters to improve predictive performance.

Churn Prediction: Deploy the best-performing model to predict customer churn for the Telco company.

## Advantages
Retention Strategies: The predictive model will enable the Telco company to implement targeted retention strategies, such as personalized offers or discounts, to retain customers at risk of churning.

Resource Allocation: By identifying potential churners, the company can allocate resources more efficiently by focusing efforts on high-risk customers, rather than implementing broad and costly retention strategies.

Customer Satisfaction: Understanding churn factors can help the company improve services, address pain points, and enhance overall customer satisfaction.

Competitive Edge: Utilizing ML for churn prediction can give the Telco company a competitive edge by being proactive and responsive to customer needs.

## Information of Dataset:
The dataset contains 7043 rows (customers) and 21 columns (features) which provides comprehensive information about a Telco company's customers, enabling a detailed analysis of customer churn and preferences. It includes the following key aspects:

CustomerId : Customer Id

Gender : Gender

SeniorCitizen : Whether the customer is a senior citizen (1, 0)

Partner : Whether the client has a partner (Yes, No) ? Married or not. Living together, being roommates

Dependents : Whether the client has dependents (Yes, No) (Child, mother, father, grandmother)

tenure : Number of months the customer stays with the company PhoneService : Whether the customer has phone service (Yes, No)

MultipleLines : Whether the customer has more than one line (Yes, No, No phone service)

InternetService : Customer's internet service provider (DSL, Fiber optic, No)

OnlineSecurity : Whether the customer has online security (Yes, No, No Internet service)

OnlineBackup : Whether the customer has online backup (Yes, No, No Internet service)

DeviceProtection : Whether the customer has device protection (Yes, No, No Internet service)

TechSupport : Whether the customer receives technical support (Yes, No, No Internet service)

StreamingTV : Whether the customer has streaming TV (Yes, No, no Internet service) (The customer has a third-party indicates whether the provider uses the Internet service to broadcast television programs)

StreamingMovies : Whether the customer has streaming movies (Yes, No, No Internet service) (Customer has a third-party Indicates whether the customer is using the Internet service to stream movies from the provider)

Contract : Duration of the customer's contract (Month to month, One year, Two years)

PaperlessBilling : Whether the customer has a paperless bill (Yes, No)

PaymentMethod : Customer's payment method (Electronic check, Postal check, Bank transfer (automatic), Credit card (automatic)

MonthlyCharges : Amount charged to the customer monthly

TotalCharges : Total amount charged to the customer

Churn : Whether the customer is using or not (Yes or No) - Customers who left in the last month or quarter.

Each row represents a unique customer. Variables contain information about customer service, account and demographic data. Services that customers sign up for => phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, technical support and TV and movie streaming. Customer account information => how long they have been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly fees and total fees. Demographic information about clients => gender, age range and partners and dependents whether or not.
